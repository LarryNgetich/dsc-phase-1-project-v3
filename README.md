# Aircraft Risk Management Analysis

## Overview

The **Aircraft Risk Management Analysis** project investigates historical aviation accident data to identify aircraft with the lowest risk profiles. As our company expands into the aviation sector, understanding safety risks is essential for making informed decisions regarding aircraft acquisitions.

## Business Understanding

### Stakeholders

- **Company Executives**: Responsible for strategic decisions regarding aircraft purchases and safety measures.
- **Safety Analysts**: Focused on evaluating and improving safety protocols within the aviation sector.
- **Marketing Team**: Aims to understand safety records to enhance customer confidence in our services.

### Key Business Questions

1. Which aircraft models have the lowest accident rates historically?
2. What trends can be observed in aviation accidents over the years?
3. Are there specific factors associated with higher risks of accidents?

## Data Understanding and Analysis

### Source of Data

The data for this analysis is sourced from the **National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB)**, which maintains comprehensive records of civil aviation accidents.

### Description of Data

The dataset contains detailed records of aviation accidents from 1962 to 2023, including information on aircraft types, accident dates, locations, and causes. This data is critical for identifying trends and understanding risk factors associated with different aircraft models.
